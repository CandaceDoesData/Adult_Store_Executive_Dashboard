# Adult_Store_Executive_Dashboard

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to gain insight into Sales and Profit acquired over a span of 4 years.  


## Tableau Dashboard
With this Dashboard we can gain an overall view of business performance metrics such as:  
what time of the year is most profitable, what department/ category makes the most sales and returns,   
what supplier has the most popular items, what sales rep sells the most items and in which department,  
which items have the highest and lowest profit margin, which Holiday Weekend is the busiest, etc.

## Market Basket Analysis
A Market Basket Analysis was also performed on all departments of the store data. This was done to see  
which items were the most popular in each department and get a view of what items were sold together  
the most often. One analysis was done on the store sales as a whole, one analysis done on each individual  
department alone, and then one analysis done on departments that were closely related such as: Wearables,  
Books & Gifts, and All Toys.
